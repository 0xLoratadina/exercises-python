# Python Array Manipulation Exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises focused on the creation and manipulation of one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, including validations and error handling using Python.

## Exercise 1: Generate an array of 20 integers
**Description**: Write a program that randomly generates an array of 20 integers. The sum of the first 10 elements must be greater than the sum of the last 10 elements. The program must display both the original and the modified array.

**Requirements**:
- Use at least one array, depending on the logic.
- Include validations (custom or using built-in functions).
- Arrays must be initialized before use.
- Prevent program interruptions due to errors.
- The `random` library can be used to generate random numbers.

## Exercise 2: Row swap in a 2D array
**Description**: Write a function that swaps the i-th row with the j-th row in a 2D array of size m × n.

**Requirements**:
- Use a two-dimensional array (can be pre-filled with values).
- Properly validate inputs (custom or utility-based).
- Arrays must be initialized before use.
- The program should handle errors properly to avoid crashes.

## Exercise 3: Replace duplicate values in an array
**Description**: Write a function that takes an array with duplicate integers. Each repeated value should be replaced with `-5`, and the function must return the modified array along with the count of modified entries.

**Requirements**:
- Use at least one array, which can have predefined values.
- Include proper validations (custom or utility-based).
- Arrays must be initialized before use.
- Prevent program interruptions due to errors.

## Exercise 4: Text reading into a string array
**Description**: Define an array of strings to read a text of up to 80 lines. Create a method that receives the text and the number of lines as arguments.

**Requirements**:
- Use at least one array.
- Include necessary validations.
- Arrays must be initialized before appending data.
- Prevent errors that could interrupt the program.

## Exercise 5: Electoral data processing
**Description**: Process the results of a mayoral election in a town, where the program must:
1. Print the vote table per candidate.
2. Calculate and print the total votes received by each candidate and their vote percentage.
3. Identify the candidate with more than 50% of the votes or the two most voted candidates for a second round.

**Electoral Data Table**:

| District | Candidate A | Candidate B | Candidate C | Candidate D |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1        | 194         | 48          | 206         | 45          |
| 2        | 180         | 20          | 320         | 16          |
| 3        | 221         | 90          | 140         | 20          |
| 4        | 432         | 50          | 821         | 14          |
| 5        | 820         | 61          | 946         | 18          |

**Requirements**:
- Use one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.
- Perform necessary validations.
- Arrays must be initialized before appending data.
- Avoid program interruptions due to errors.

## Exercise 6: Sum elements in a 2D array
**Description**: Create a program that calculates the sum of the elements in the main diagonal and the upper triangle of an N×M 2D array, then subtracts the sum of the elements in the lower triangle.

**Requirements**:
- Use a two-dimensional array.
- Include necessary validations.
- Arrays must be initialized before use.
- Properly handle errors to avoid program crashes.
